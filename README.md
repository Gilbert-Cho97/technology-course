# Seoul Christian School Technology Course

This is the central git repository for Mr. Olinda's technology course.

Below you'll find the syllabus and basic course information. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/seoul-christian-school/technology-course/wiki) for more specific information.

## What to Bring to Class

Each day you should have the following items with you:

1. Laptop
2. Notebook
3. Pencil case

As we get further into the class there may be specific tools that I need you to bring with you

## Communication

If you have a question, the best place to put it is Slack. If you have a specific problem with a file in the repository, then feel free to submit an issue or pull request.

### Slack

The class Slack channel is #tech and if you've not gotten an invitation, please talk to Mr. Olinda after class or after school to get set up.

### Email

You'll sometimes need to communicate via email and if you do, you should always use a classmate or teacher's seoulchristian.org email address for school communication. Mr. Olinda will ignore emails sent to his personal email.

### IRC

Mr. Olinda maintains an IRC channel for class at #room304. We will use this for demonstration purposes several times during the year but it should not be used for critical communication since it won't be actively monitored.

## Syllabus

### First Quarter Schedule

#### Unit 0: How to Be a Good Student

The first week of class will be composed of several lessons to help you become a more effective student. We will cover the classroom behavior, homework, testing, and sleep.

#### Unit 1: Basics
