### Command Line Crash Course: Introduction

#### Summary

I'm going to learn how to use the command line on my computer, and I'll be expected to memorize basic terms and perform certain tasks using only the command line. He really emphasizes memorizing the terms until they become extremely easy for me to remember, so I'm guessing that will be important.

#### Progress

I finished reading the assignment and I'm moving on to the next one.

#### Questions

Why does he recommend writing by hand since this is a programming assignment? Wouldn't it make more sense to just use the computer?
