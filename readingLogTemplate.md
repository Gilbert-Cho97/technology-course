### [Git 1.1: About Version Control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

#### Summary

There are local, central, and distributed version control systems, and each one seems to have its own advantages. Overall though distributed systems seem best because they have all the advantages of the other two. However, I guess that having a copy of the repository on each computer could be a security risk since the data could be stolen just by getting one of the computers instead of having to hack into the server.

#### Questions

Is something like GitHub similar to Google Docs, but for all files instead of just documents and presentations?

### [Five Minutes to Markdown Mastery](http://www.remarq.io/articles/five-minutes-to-markdown-mastery/)

#### Summary

Markdown is designed to be readable even if it hasn't been rendered by a computer. So if I take my class notes in Markdown, I will be able to understand them in five or ten or fifty years, even if the software I used to render them doesn't exist anymore. I could even print out the notes and they would make sense.

This means I don't have to rely on anything or anyone as long as I have a machine that understands basic .txt files, which aren't going away anytime soon.

Markdown also makes it really easy to build basic web pages, which is probably something that will come in handy for this class.

#### Questions

What types of programs support Markdown on Windows? Which one's the best one?
